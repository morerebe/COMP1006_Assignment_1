This is a digital grocery shopping list tracker! List items, their prices, categories, quantity and even notes! 

The "Item" field is required, categories are populated from an additional table in the database, and quantity requires a number input. 


View your full shopping list when an item is inputted & saved!


*The category tab isn't saving the input to the database, but I'm really unsure how to resolve*
